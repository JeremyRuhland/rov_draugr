Western Washington University Marine Technology Club 2014 ROV: Draugr
=====================================================================

More information can be found on my [WWU MTC page](http://goopypanther.org/seniorProjectWebsite/wwu-marine-technology-club.html) or the [main blog post](http://blog.goopypanther.org/posts/ROV_Project:_Draugr/) about Draugr.

The stuff here's pretty old and probably doesn't reflect the current state of the ROV. Some firmware tweaks may have been made last minute in responce to hardware changes. Only the basic functionality was fully implemented and tested.

You can control the ROV via a screen session and the keyboard, the actual GUI that uses the xbox controller was written by Sean and got stored elsewhere (somewhere?).
